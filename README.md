## My process

- Creating variables for future ready responsive website.
- Targetting which one is most important (mobile/desktop)
- Then, I made css for that then convert it for another devices via media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learnt

- Actually the mobile layout not good when resizing. because its not responsive. so i decided to shrink both images and padding of it's container. So i used here min() function and clamp() function to achieve this.
